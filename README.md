## Inspiration

Public cloud has become the stepping stone that enables all of us to build, deploy, and scale applications within minutes. You no longer need a basement with air conditioning, cooling systems, and multiple backup generators to launch your next idea on the web‚Äîall because with a few clicks, we can rent a server in a remote datacenter.

The public cloud market is currently valued at around **$723.4 billion USD** and is growing by **21.5% year over year**. From decentralized blockchain Ethereum nodes to centralized movie streaming websites like Netflix, to governments‚Äîeveryone is on public cloud.

However, despite this massive adoption, **cloud is tricky**. People with years of experience make mistakes and even costly blunders. The UI isn't very intuitive, nobody truly understands public cloud pricing, and it's really difficult to use the cloud the right way.

This is where **HawkEye** comes in‚Äîan AI agent designed to monitor your public cloud accounts, identify security recommendations, and provide actionable insights on how you can reduce costs.
