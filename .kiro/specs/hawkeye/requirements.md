# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HawkEye is a cloud cost optimization and resource monitoring platform designed to simplify AWS management for beginners and experienced users alike. The platform consolidates information scattered across multiple AWS services (Cost Explorer, EC2 Dashboard, Storage Class Analytics, S3 Inventory) into a unified dashboard with intelligent recommendations. Users can authenticate via Google, onboard their AWS accounts, configure S3 monitoring, and receive actionable insights about their cloud resources through automated agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cloud user, I want to authenticate using my Google account, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating separate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a "Login with Google" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the Google login button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth flow
3. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve the user's profile
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the account onboarding or dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to onboard my AWS account by granting necessary permissions, so that HawkEye can analyze my cloud resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL display the account onboarding flow
2. WHEN displaying onboarding THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for AWS IAM role creation
3. WHEN a user provides AWS account credentials or role ARN THEN the system SHALL validate the permissions
4. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL display specific missing permissions and remediation steps
5. WHEN account onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL store the account configuration securely
6. WHEN onboarding fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to onboard my S3 buckets for monitoring, so that I can receive storage optimization recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN S3 onboarding starts THEN the system SHALL discover and list all S3 buckets in the account
2. WHEN buckets are listed THEN the system SHALL display current space usage for each bucket
3. WHEN a user selects buckets to monitor THEN the system SHALL enable Storage Class Analytics for those buckets
4. WHEN Storage Class Analytics is enabled THEN the system SHALL configure S3 Inventory for the selected buckets
5. WHEN bucket configuration fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and allow retry
6. WHEN S3 onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL save the monitoring configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a dashboard showing my last analysis results, so that I can quickly understand my current cloud resource status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display statistics from the most recent analysis run
2. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show S3 storage recommendations and cost savings opportunities
3. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show EC2 resource utilization and optimization suggestions
4. WHEN no previous analysis exists THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message with instructions to run first analysis
5. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "RUN" button to trigger new analysis
6. WHEN displaying the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show a "More services coming" section for future features

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to trigger on-demand analysis of my AWS resources, so that I can get up-to-date optimization recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the RUN button THEN the system SHALL initiate both S3 and EC2 analysis agents
2. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators for each agent
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard with new results
4. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and allow retry
5. WHEN multiple analyses are requested THEN the system SHALL queue or prevent concurrent runs appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive S3 storage optimization recommendations, so that I can reduce my storage costs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 agent runs THEN the system SHALL analyze data from S3 Inventory reports instead of direct object listing
2. WHEN analyzing S3 data THEN the system SHALL identify objects suitable for different storage classes
3. WHEN analyzing object age THEN the system SHALL implement algorithms to detect objects that are too old and recommend lifecycle policies
4. WHEN analyzing file patterns THEN the system SHALL detect too many parquet files and recommend compaction strategies
5. WHEN analyzing directory structure THEN the system SHALL detect lack of partitioning with too many files and recommend partitioning strategies
6. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL calculate potential cost savings for each suggestion
7. WHEN recommendations are ready THEN the system SHALL display actionable steps with estimated savings
8. WHEN no optimization opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL display confirmation that storage is optimized
9. WHEN S3 analysis fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and display user-friendly error messages
10. WHEN encountering bucket access errors like PermanentRedirect THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle cross-region bucket access issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive EC2 resource optimization recommendations, so that I can eliminate waste and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the EC2 agent runs THEN the system SHALL make API requests to gather EC2 and EBS information
2. WHEN analyzing EC2 resources THEN the system SHALL identify unattached or unused EBS volumes
3. WHEN analyzing instances THEN the system SHALL detect overutilized or underutilized instances
4. WHEN generating EC2 recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide specific actions with cost impact
5. WHEN recommendations are ready THEN the system SHALL display prioritized suggestions based on potential savings
6. WHEN EC2 analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see that additional AWS services will be supported in the future, so that I can plan for comprehensive cloud optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a "More services coming" section
2. WHEN displaying future services THEN the system SHALL list planned AWS services for future releases
3. WHEN a user interacts with future services THEN the system SHALL provide information about expected availability
4. WHEN displaying roadmap information THEN the system SHALL allow users to express interest or request specific services
